  + Copy Paper ID to all rows involving that paper.
  + Copy Condition to all relevant rows. 
  + Create a new column containing "Continuous", "Quartile" etc.
  + Delete blank rows within a paper, currently left blank rows separating papers to make it easier to read
  + Highlighted any obviously dubious cells/entries in Red, left yellow ones from Stephen for clarification
  + Tidied up "minus" entries - Note that the Confidence Interval notation is not standardised! 
  + Explicitly annotated "plus" with the prior categories
  + Removed "adj" from conditions, where the covariates indicate a deeper analysis
  + Inserted annotations, such as "- male", into the "Condition" description to uniquely identify each test.
